        <h1>Introduction</h1> 

        <p class="intro">Sysopia is web-based application which can be used to track and analyze system information such as CPU usage, memory usage, network usage in 2-20 computer systems at the same time. It acts like a dashboard for the system administrators.</p>

        <img src="images/dashboard.png" class='images' alt="Dashboard">

        <p>Below are the types of information which you are able to view through Sysopia.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Average Load(1 Min)</li>
          <li>Memory Usage</li>
          <li>Max Partition Usage</li>
          <li>Reads from Disk</li>
          <li>Writes to Disk</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Average Load(1 Min)</h4> 
        <span>The system load is a measurement of the computational work the system is performing. This measurement is displayed as a number. A completely idle computer has a load average of 0. Each running process either using or waiting for CPU resources adds 1 to the load average. So, if your system has a load of 5, five processes are either using or waiting for the CPU.</span>
        </br>
        <span>On its own, the load number doesn’t mean too much. A computer might have a load of 0 one split-second, and a load of 5 the next split-second as several processes use the CPU. Even if you could see the load at any given time, that number would be basically meaningless.That’s where "load average" comes into play."Load average" is an average of the computer’s load over several periods of time. This allows you to see how much work your computer has been performing.</span>

        <h4>Memory Usage</h4>
        <span>This is simply the percentage of the memory which are currently being utilized at the moments.</span>

        <h4>Max Partition Usage</h4>
        <span>This represents the current utilization of the max used partition of the system.</span>

        <h4>Reads from Disk</h4>
        <span>Represents the amount of data reads per second from the disks.</span>

        <h4>Writes to Disk</h4>
        <span>Represents the amount of data written per second to the disks.</span>

        <p class="intro">Select time range using buttons</p>
        <img src="images/time_range_buttons.png" class='images' alt="Time range buttons">
        <p>You can select a preferreble time range using the above buttons. Clicking them will redirect you to a new url. You can customize the parameters on those urls according to your preferences. More on that will be exaplained under "Features"</p>

        <p class="intro">Hide/show selected computers</p>
        <img src="images/hide_show_graphs.png" class='images' alt="Hide/show selected computers">
        <p>Default behavior of Sysopia is to show graphs of every computer together, but sometimes it could be annoying and may difficult to analyze the behavior of just one computer. As a solution for that you can use the checkbox next to the name of each computer on the legend to control their visibility on the graph. You can also use "Select all" and "Deselect all" buttons to control all the computers at once.</p>

        <h1>Features</h1>       

        <p class="intro">Human friendly URL system</p>
        <p>Sysopia is equipped with a powerful URL based time range selector. Apart from the default time range buttons defined in the top menu, you can use URL parameters to customize the time range of the graphs according to your needs.</p>

        <p>Below are url formats support in Sysopia to change time range.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Specifying "start date/time and/or "end" date/time</li>
          <li>Specifying "start" date/time and "length" duration</li>
          <li>Specifying "time_window" duration and/or "offset" date/time</li>
          <li>Specifying "ago" date/time</li>          
        </ul>

        <h4>Specifying "start date/time and/or "end" date/time</h4> 
        <span>"start" parameter represents the starting boundary of the time range. "end" parameter represents the ending boundary of the time range. You can use regular date formats as well as Unix time format. You can also skip the end parameter if you want to set the ending boundary of the time range to current time. You can use huge number of human-friendly date and time formats here.</span>
        </br>
        </br>
        <span>Ex :-</span>
        <ul>
          <li>start=142332345332&end=142332360000</li>
          <li>start=142332345332</li>
          <li>start=2015/08/20&end=2015/08/30</li>           
          <li>start=2015-08-20</li>
          <li>start=2015-08-20 05:00:00</li>          
          <li>start=7 hours ago</li>
          <li>start=yesterday at 18:00</li>
          <li>start=August 20 2015 at 3:00 PM</li>   
          <li>start=August 2015</li>
          <li>start=August 20</li>
          <li>start=12:00</li>  
          <li>start=1 PM</li>                               
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Specifying "start" date/time and "length" duration</h4> 
        <span>"start" parameter represents the starting boundry of the time range. "length" parameter represents a time duration which is to be counted</span>
        </br>
        </br>
        <span>Ex :-</span>
        <ul>
          <li>time_window=5hours</li>
          <li>time_window=5hours&offset=1hour</li>
          <li>time_window=5 days&offset=4 hours</li>                   
        </ul>

        <h4>Specifying "time_window" duration and/or "offset" date/time</h4> 
        <span>"time_window" indicates a time duration which is used to count backward from the current time. "offset" also represents a time duration which can be used to alter the current date and time. You can ignore the "offset" parameter if you want to use the current time as the ending boundary.
        </br>
        You can specify both parameters using seconds, minutes, hours and days. However it doesn't support months or years.</span>
        </br>
        </br>
        <span>Ex :-</span>
        <ul>
          <li>time_window=5hours</li>
          <li>time_window=5hours&offset=1hour</li>
          <li>time_window=5 days&offset=4 hours</li>                   
        </ul>

        <h4>Specifying "ago" date/time</h4> 
        <span>You can specify the ago parameter using seconds, minutes, hours and days, but using months or years.</span>
        </br>
        </br>
        <span>Ex :-</span>
        <ul>
          <li>ago=5 seconds</li>
          <li>ago=5 sec</li>
          <li>ago=5 s</li>
          <li>ago=5s</li>   
          <li>ago=5 hours</li>       
        </ul>

        <p class="intro">Zoom-in option</p>
        <p>In order to analyze the graphs more closly, zoom-in is needed. In Sysopia, zoom-in can be done in two ways.</p>   
        <ul>
          <li>Click and drag</li>
          <li>Ajusting the timeline</li>          
        </ul>

        <p class="intro_sub">Click and drag</p>
        <img src="images/zoom_by_click_and_drag.png" class='images' alt="Zoom by click and drag">        
        <p>You can click and drag the mouse to select the area that you want to zoom. After the mouse button is released that area will be magnified. Later, if you want to go back to the earlier view, you can click the "Reset zoom" button, which will appear at the bottom right corner of the graph.</p>

        <p class="intro_sub">Ajusting the timeline</p>
        <img src="images/zoom_by_ajusting_timeline.png" class='images' alt="Zoom by adjusting the timeline">
        <p>You can also zoom a graph, using the timeline which is situated below the graph. You can change the width of the blue segment of the timeline according to your preference (width is equally proportional to the time density of the graph). Furthermore, you can drag the blue segment horizontally, which will change position of the graph too because the graph is in sync with it.</p>

        <p class="intro">Print option</p>
        <img src="images/print_graph.png" class='images_s' alt="Print Graph">
        <p>You can use the "Print chart" button which is located at the top right corner of every graph in order to print that graph.</p>
