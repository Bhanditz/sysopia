        <h1>Introduction</h1> 

        <p class="intro">Sysopia is web based application which can be used to track and analyze system information such as CPU usage, memory usage, network usage in 2-20 computer systems at the same time. It acts like a dashboard for the system administrators.</p>

        <img src="images/dashboard.png" class='images' alt="Dashboard">

        <p>Below are the types of information which you are able to view through Sysopia.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Average Load(1 Min)</li>
          <li>Memory Usage</li>
          <li>Max Partition Usage</li>
          <li>Reads from Disk</li>
          <li>Writes to Disk</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Average Load(1 Min)</h4> 
        <span>The system load is a measurement of the computational work the system is performing. This measurement is displayed as a number. A completely idle computer has a load average of 0. Each running process either using or waiting for CPU resources adds 1 to the load average. So, if your system has a load of 5, five processes are either using or waiting for the CPU.</span>
        </br>
        <span>On its own, the load number doesn’t mean too much. A computer might have a load of 0 one split-second, and a load of 5 the next split-second as several processes use the CPU. Even if you could see the load at any given time, that number would be basically meaningless.That’s where "load average" comes in to play."Load average" is an average of the computer’s load over several periods of time. This allows you to see how much work your computer has been performing.</span>

        <h4>Memory Usage</h4>
        <span>This is simply the percentage of the memory which are currently being utilized at the moments.</span>

        <h4>Max Partition Usage</h4>
        <span>This represents the current utilization of the max used partition of the system.</span>

        <h4>Reads from Disk</h4>
        <span>Represents the amount of data reads per second from the disks.</span>

        <h4>Writes to Disk</h4>
        <span>Represents the amount of data written per second to the disks.</span>

        <img src="images/time_range_buttons.png" class='images' alt="Time range buttons">
        <p>You can select a preferreble time range using the above buttons. Clicking them will redirect you to a new url. You can customize the parameters on those urls according to your preferences. More on that will be exaplained under "Features"</p>

        <p class="intro">Hide/show selected computers</p>
        <img src="images/hide_show_graphs.png" class='images' alt="Hide/show selected computers">
        <p>Default behavior of Sysopia, is to show graphs of every computer together, but sometimes it could be annoying and may difficult to analyze the behavior of just one computer. As solution for that you can use the check box next to the name of each computer on the legend to control their visibility on the graph. You can also use "Select all" and "Deselect all" buttons to control all the computers at once.</p>

        <p class="intro">Zoom-in option</p>
        <p>In order to analyze the graphs more closly, zoom-in is needed. In Sysopia, zoom-in can be done in two ways.</p>   
        <ul>
          <li>Using "click and drag"</li>
          <li>Using the timeline</li>

        <p>You can use the "Print chart" button which is located at the top right corner of every graph in order to print that graph.</p>
